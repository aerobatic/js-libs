# Aerobatic JS Libs

This repo contains Aerobatic client JS helper libs. Currently the only script is `paywall.js` which is a drop-in script that encapsulates the client-side integration with the Aerobatic [paywall plugin](https://www.aerobatic.com/docs/plugins/paywall/).

The [paywall-demo](https://github.com/aerobatic/paywall-demo) repo demonstrates how to use the paywall lib in a Jekyll site.

Libs can referenced off our CDN or you can of course copy it to your own project.
